<Card title="Warning" icon="warning">We are not related to Scott Cawthon or Kane Carter.</Card>

The blackrabbit is a character from the popular fangame "POPGOES" by Kane Carter. We chose Blackrabbit because cooperation is needed for her be built, Popgoes prints while the other animatronics distract the player. In the same way, we are a cooperative site, and help is always welcome!
